# Researchfiles
Some scripts I use in my research.

Use Makefile can easily do place and route in Innovus, change nan15.pl to fit other cell libraries.

Use via.py and resistivity.py and easily calculate the via resistance and Cu resistivity only with inputing witdh. 

Use linear_regression.py can do a simple linear-regression job.

Use spef.pl can generate the script for StarRC to generate SPEF file.

Use deletespef.txt and sumnet can summarize and delete the certain position data.

Use ratio.pl can recieve the STDIN and calculate the ratio.
